\emph{Background:} Falls are a major health hazard among the elderly. Several systems have been created to address this issue. The majority of these systems are not portable and require the subjects to be located in a medical facility. There have been numerous attempts at creating mobile systems, but their focus is on fall detection, not fall prevention.\\
\emph{Method:} In this paper we will create a prototype to explore the viability of using cheap, off the shelf, motion based game controllers and Android smartphones in order to create a mobile biofeedback system. The game controllers functions as a sensor device, while the Android phone functions as a processing hub. Informal tests were conducted to evaluate the viability of the prototype.\\
\emph{Results:} A prototype was created, connecting a Wii Remote with MotionPlus extension to an Android HTC Desire HD smartphone. Viability test showed that battery life, performance and range were satisfactory, while the vibration feedback from the Wii Remote was considered too weak.\\
\emph{Conclusion:} The project showed that an Android smartphone and a Wii Remote game controller can be utilized to create a mobile biofeedback system, though further work and research is needed to create a system that is effective in practical situations.
